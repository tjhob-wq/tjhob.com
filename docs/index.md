# T.J. Hob

I have no idea why anyone would be curious enough about me to visit my personal site, but here
are a few tidbits for the curious.

*My opinions are my own. I do not speak for my employer, parents, children, spouse, or anyone else.*

## Current projects

We'll see how long this stays "current".

* Open edX - I work on building and maintaining the software that runs a few thousand online education sites, serving a few 10s of millions of learners around the world.
* Veilid / VeilidChat - I'm playing around with and learning the Veilid and VeilidChat software, currently trying to whip the Python bindings into shape and help sort out Python primitives.
* Joey - This is my attempt to reverse engineer various parts of VeilidChat to create a bot that can accept chat invites and perform some rudimetary debugging and conversation to help test the network and Python bindings.
* AudioCali - This is my attempt to get Calibre to load up my audiobook library next to my ebooks via a plugin that reads m4b metadata. It kinda works.
* Homestead - This isn't a piece of software, I literally have a 50 acre homestead that grows around 75% of my food throughout the year. We have sheep, goats, horses, and a wild garden.

## Past projects

I'm old and have worked on a variety of more-or-less interesting projects over the years. Here are some things
that I thought were fun or interesting and you may have heard of.

* Rock Band - I did a bunch of work on _all_ of the many RB games, track packs, etc. Mostly network stuff with multiplayer, leaderboards, and the store.
* Dance Central - Same here, I worked on all of these basically doing the same stuff.
* Fantasia: Music Evolved (F:ME) - I had to write a multi-platform HTTP client stack from libcurl up for this one since XB1 and PS4 didn't have first party networking nailed down while we were building it.
* Beatniks - The cutest little mobile game that no one played.
* Lord of the Rings Online - I was a network lead on this team, overseeing much smarter people who wrote the chat / voice chat / login / launcher / patcher / billing / reporting / etc. for this modestly successful MMO.
* Dungeons and Dragons Online - I did a bunch of web dev and billing for this before being catapulted into the network lead role as above. We had a really slick web to game integration featuring a bunch of clan forums and calendering stuff that sadly was never used. Boo.
* Various websites for sports teams and venues such as the Tampa Bay Lightning
