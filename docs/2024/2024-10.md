New project incoming, I've got a Spec5 Nomad Meshtastic device landing in a couple of days and am pretty excited to try it out both here in the woods where we get no phone serviec, and out in Boston next week to see what the nerds there are up to. If things go well I'm hoping to set up a big solar powered repeater on our hillside that should allow our pocket devices to communicate across the entire farm and beyond to where there actually is some signal.

From there, it'd be nice to have a home device that can run a Meshtastic BBS and also repeat things out to the internet at large. Starting out for the lulz and family communication out in the woods, but it'd be nice to have a local mutual aid system for those few times a year when the power goes out for a day or so. My solar + satellite internet setup could be helpful for folks who need help or to communicate out that they're ok. We'll see!
