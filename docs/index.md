# T.J. Hob

I have no idea why anyone would be curious enough about me to visit my personal site, but here
are a few tidbits for the curious.

*My opinions are my own. I do not speak for my employer, parents, children, spouse, or anyone else.*

## Current projects

We'll see how long this stays "current".

* Rural Meshtastic hub - I'm working on setting up a small Meshtastic network for my homestead and surrounding area. This is brand new, we'll see how it goes!
* Open edX - I work on building and maintaining the software that runs a few thousand online education sites, serving a few 10s of millions of learners around the world.
* Veilid / VeilidChat - I'm playing around with and learning the Veilid and VeilidChat software, currently trying to whip the Python bindings into shape and help sort out Python primitives.
* Joey - This is my attempt to reverse engineer various parts of VeilidChat to create a bot that can accept chat invites and perform some rudimetary debugging and conversation to help test the network and Python bindings.
* AudioCali - This is my attempt to get Calibre to load up my audiobook library next to my ebooks via a plugin that reads m4b metadata. It kinda works.
* Homestead - This isn't a piece of software, I literally have a 50 acre homestead that grows around 75% of my food throughout the year. We have sheep, goats, horses, and a wild garden.
