# Past projects

I'm old and have worked on a variety of more-or-less interesting projects over the years. Here are some things
that I thought were fun or interesting and you may have heard of.

* Rock Band - I did a bunch of work on _all_ of the many RB games, track packs, etc. Mostly network stuff with multiplayer, leaderboards, and the store.
* Dance Central - Same here, I worked on all of these basically doing the same stuff.
* Fantasia: Music Evolved (F:ME) - I had to write a multi-platform HTTP client stack from libcurl up for this one since XB1 and PS4 didn't have first party networking nailed down while we were building it.
* Beatniks - The cutest little mobile game that no one played.
* Lord of the Rings Online - I was a network lead on this team, overseeing much smarter people who wrote the chat / voice chat / login / launcher / patcher / billing / reporting / etc. for this modestly successful MMO.
* Dungeons and Dragons Online - I did a bunch of web dev and billing for this before being catapulted into the network lead role as above. We had a really slick web to game integration featuring a bunch of clan forums and calendering stuff that sadly was never used. Boo.
* Various websites for sports teams and venues such as the Tampa Bay Lightning
