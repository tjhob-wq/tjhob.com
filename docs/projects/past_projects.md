# Past projects

I'm old and have worked on a variety of more-or-less interesting projects over the years. Here are some things that I thought were fun or interesting and you may have heard of.

- [Rock Band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Band) - I did a bunch of work on almost all of the many RB games, track packs, etc. Mostly network stuff with multiplayer, leaderboards, and the store.
- [Dance Central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Central) - Same here, I worked on all of these basically doing the same stuff.
- [Fantasia: Music Evolved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasia:_Music_Evolved) (F:ME) - Terrible foray into working with Disney. I had to write a multi-platform HTTP client stack from libcurl up for this one since XB1 and PS4 didn't have first party networking nailed down while we were building it. It included the worst bug I ever created.
- [Beatniks](https://www.harmonixmusic.com/blog/welcoming-beatniks-to-the-harmonix-game-family/) - The cutest little mobile game that no one played. Go to create a hyper efficient load test harness / DDOS generator for it, though.
- [Lord of the Rings Online](https://www.lotro.com/home) - I was a network lead on this team, overseeing much smarter people who wrote the chat / voice chat / login / launcher / patcher / billing / reporting / etc. for this modestly successful MMO.
- [Dungeons and Dragons Online](https://www.ddo.com/home) - I did a bunch of web dev and billing for this before being catapulted into the network lead role as above. We had a really slick web to game integration featuring a bunch of clan forums and calendering stuff that sadly was never used. Boo.
- ¤®¤elentless ]V\[od - mod for Unreal Tournament '99, somewhere between ]V\[ega]V\[od and low-grav instagib. Super flak cannon, gib rifle, black hole gun, 135% speed, low grav, etc.
- ¤®¤elentless stats - log parsing / stats colleciton / PHP website for Unreal Tournament '99 and '03. Did k/d ratios, leaderboard, best / worst weapons per player on our clan servers
- Various websites for sports teams and venues such as the Tampa Bay Lightning
- Sales, tech support, domain registration support, and eventually system administration for the "world's largest web host" circa 1998
- KivaX - An IRC bot derived from / built on BitchX to perform various operations on pagan themed channels, but mostly to fight off and counter-attack the frequent attempts to gain ops on those channels by various religious fundamentalists
- A handful of Amiga demos inspired by various Psygnosis game intros
- Various odd musical projects composed in OctaMED on Amiga 500 / 1200s. This software was way ahead of its time.
- Battle of the Planets - A "choose your own adventure" story / game I wrote in TRS-80 BASIC when I was like 10
