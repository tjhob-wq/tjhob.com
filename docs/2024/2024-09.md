I've left a wildly scattered trail of bits across the digital landfill since I started with a SLIP/PPP connection in '94. Longer if you count Prodigy, Quantum Link, and BBSs. Does anyone else count those? We've come a long way from the days when my dad ripped my phone jack out of the wall in a rage that my long distance bill was in the hundreds of dollars from calling BBSs... how was I to know there could be charges inside the same area code? Seems unfair, tbh.

Anyway, I'm putting this site together to try to consolidate all of my varied activities and interests into one place. I predict this will go the way of every other personal site and blog I've ever done, but it's so low effort I won't even be mad. At the end of the day I just want the domain for my new name and a place to info dump on my projects.
